    support organics and millets, including the organisation of annual organic & millet
    trade fairs since 2017 to promote millets as a people’s movement, striving to position
    Bangalore as the ‘global hub for millets’. Owing to these concerted efforts, once
    near-extinct minor millets have experienced a remarkable revival and are now in high
    demand as healthy traditional foods.
    
    In order to double the income of farmers in the State, there is a need to provide
    appropriate platform to establish market linkages to farmers by showcasing
    value-added products, natural products and other related products under various
    schemes implemented by the Secondary Agriculture Directorate, the Department of
    Agriculture and the Watershed Development Department, Karnataka Agro Processing
    and Export Corporation (KAPPEC), Karnataka State Seeds Corporation (KSSC) and
    Karnataka Pulses Development Board.
    
    The Department of Agriculture, Government of Karnataka, successfully organized
    Organic and Millets International Trade Fairs in the years 2017, 2018, 2019, 2023,
    2024 and 2025. These events attracted a large number of stakeholders, generated
    significant interest and achieved notable success.',
